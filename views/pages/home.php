          <h4>Introduction to Data Structures</h4>
          <p>Data Structure is a way of collecting and organising data in such a way that we can perform operations on these data in an effective way. Data Structures is about rendering data elements in terms of some relationship, for better organization and storage. For example, we have data player's name "Virat" and age 26. Here "Virat" is of String data type and 26 is of integer data type. We can organize this data as a record like Player record. </p>

          <h4>What is Algorithm ?</h4>
          <p>An algorithm is a finite set of instructions or logic, written in order, to accomplish a certain predefined task. Algorithm is not the complete code or program, it is just the core logic(solution) of a problem, which can be expressed either as an informal high level description as pseudocode or using a flowchart. An algorithm is said to be efficient and fast, if it takes less time to execute and consumes less memory space.</p>

          <h4>Space Complexity</h4>
          <p>Its the amount of memory space required by the algorithm, during the course of its execution. Space complexity must be taken seriously for multi-user systems and in situations where limited memory is available. An algorithm generally requires space for following components : Instruction Space : Its the space required to store the executable version of the program. </p>
